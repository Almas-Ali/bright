# Bright - A brightness control utility for Linux systems

**version 1.0**

***Developed by Md. Almas Ali***

<br>

## Usage:

To set your screen you can use it. I have faced many truble to control just my laptop screen brightness. So, I search many where to find some solution. I found some solution but that was not working properly and some are too complicated. So, I made this utility with some interternal module in Linux with Python magic.
<br><br>
Now, I am going beond. Shifting from Python to C for better performance. But, it is in development. The Python utility is more stable than C.
<br><br>

```bash
# Set brightness level 1-100+
bright --set 80

# get brightness level
bright --get

```

## Installation:

Copy the python file in your user path.
